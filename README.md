# ${\color{red} Housing\ Price\ Analyis\ and\ Prediction}$

# ✅ ${\color{green} Objective}$
- The objective of this project is to analyze housing data to understand price behavior and build a machine learning model to accurately predict house prices using key features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and parking.

# 🛠️ ${\color{grey} Tools\ Used}$
- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Scikit-learn

- Google Colab

- CSV Dataset (Housing.csv)

# 🔄 ${\color{blue} Steps\ Included}$
1. Loaded housing dataset using Pandas

2. Performed descriptive statistics (mean, min, max)

3. Conducted correlation analysis with visualizations

4. Analyzed district-wise average prices

5. Detected outliers using boxplots and statistical filtering

6. Built Linear Regression model

7. Evaluated model using RMSE.

# 📊 ${\color{orange} Analysis\ Included}$
- Price vs Bedrooms and Bathrooms correlation analysis

- District-wise average price comparison

- Area vs Price relationship analysis

- Outlier detection using box plots

- Machine learning-based price prediction using Linear Regression.

# 🔍 ${\color{violet} Key\ Insights}$
-Area shows a strong positive correlation with price (≈ 0.53)

- Bathrooms influence price more than bedrooms

- District 5 has the highest average housing prices

- Only 6 major price outliers were detected in the dataset
# 🧾 ${\color{black} Conclusion}$
- This project successfully demonstrates how Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning can be combined to predict housing prices accurately. The Linear Regression model provides effective price estimation, while EDA reveals key market trends useful for real estate decision-making.
